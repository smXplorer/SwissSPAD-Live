The author acknowledges the contribution of Dr. Arin Ulku from the `Aqua Lab 
<https://www.epfl.ch/labs/aqua/>`_ (Prof. Edoardo Charbon) at EPFL, in the form 
of the SwissSPAD 2 & SwissSPAD 3firmware versions used in this software, as well
as the original MATLAB code from which the core of SwissSPAD Live is inspired.

The software uses code from the OpenG toolkit, and from the HDF5 bindings for 
LabVIEW by Martijn Jasperse. The software also uses the HDF5 library developed
by the HDF group, and the Opal Kelly FrontPanel API and code for communication
with FPGA.
